<h4 id="goal">Project Goal</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The challenge was establishing a website that allowed users to list recyclable products for pick up and pick up recyclable items from other users.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some of the tasks to accomplish this goal were developing the website design and the website itself and then deploying it to a server so that other people could access it using a URL.
The abovementioned tasks had to be broken down into actionable steps.</li>

<li>First, it was necessary to create an initial draft of the application by defining how it would behave.</li>

<li>Using spreadsheets was a good alternative for doing that. In the spreadsheet, it was possible to define the user stories - which actions the user would perform on the website - and the routes and resources that the application might need.</li>

<li>It was also essential to work on the database design. For that, it was necessary to create a database schema with the probable tables and their attributes and think about the connections between them.</li>

<li>Additionally, to keep track of changes in the code, it was necessary to create a Git repository and push the code up to GitHub. That was a way to guarantee that different versions of the code existed and could be used if anything went wrong.</li>

<li>Moreover, Trello was used as a project dashboard to keep track of what needed to be done (had already been done and needed to be reviewed ).</li>

<li>In order to design how the application would look, it was necessary to use Figma.</li>

<li>Figma was used to create the different screens of the website and the user flow - how the user would interact with the application and where each screen would take them. The colors, logo arrangement, and fonts were also chosen on Figma.</li>

<li>Another critical aspect of RecyBuddies was setting up the users to have more than one role on the website. They should be able to publish items for pickup but also be able to choose to pick up items from other users.</li>

<li>Finally, it was necessary to select a hosting platform for deployment to see the web application on the web. Heroku was used for deploying the application, and it also generated a web address that could be shared with other people so they could start using RecyBuddies.</li>
