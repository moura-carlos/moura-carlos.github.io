<h4 id="role">Role</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I was a Full-Stack Software Engineer in this project.
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goal">Project Goal</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The project aimed at creating an image-stock website from where users with a premium membership could download images.
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the tasks to accomplish this goal were developing the website to display the images, implementing the admin dashboard, making sure the admins could upload images to the website so that the users could download it, allowing the users to download images, adding a form where the user could enter their payment information, select a membership plan, and sign-up for the website, and then deploying the project to a server so that other people could access it using a URL.</li>
  <li>The abovementioned tasks had to be broken down into actionable steps.</li>
  <li>First, it was necessary to create an initial draft of the application by defining how it would behave.</li>
  <li>Using spreadsheets was a good alternative for doing that.</li>
  <li>In the spreadsheet, it was possible to define the user stories - which actions the customer would perform on the website - and the routes and resources that the application might need.</li>
  <li>It was also essential to work on the database design.</li>
  <li>For that, it was necessary to create a database schema with the probable tables and their attributes and think about the connections between them.</li>
  <li>Additionally, to keep track of changes in the code, it was necessary to create a Git repository and push the code up to GitHub.</li>
  <li>That was a way to guarantee that different versions of the code existed and could be used if anything went wrong.</li>
  <li>Moreover, Trello was used as a project dashboard to keep track of what needed to be done (had already been done and needed to be reviewed ).</li>
  <li>Another critical aspect of Source was using an external API to process the user payment.</li>
  <li>For payment processing, it was convenient and reliable to use Stripe's payment API as it provides a safe way to handle credit card information, change membership plans, or cancel the membership altogether. Moreover, it was critical to consider how the image upload storage would be handled.</li>
  <li>For this, it was convenient, reliable, and flexible to use Amazon AWS cloud services, more specifically using an S3 bucket for storing the images and then making them available for download to the premium users.</li>
  <li>Finally, it was necessary to select a hosting platform for deployment to see the web application on the web. Heroku was used for deploying the application, and it also generated a web address that could be shared with other people so they could start downloading images from Source.</li>
</ul>
