  <li>I was the lead back-end software engineer for this project</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goal">Project Goal</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It was necessary to create a website that showed present recommendations
based on information provided by the user.</li>
  <li>The website also had to allow the user to wishlist gifts they found interesting
as well as provide a link to an external online store if they wanted to purchase
it.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the tasks to accomplish this goal were developing the website design and the website itself and then
  deploying it to a server so that other people could access it using a URL.
</li>
<li>The abovementioned tasks had to be broken down into actionable steps.
</li>
<li>First, it was necessary to create an initial draft of the application by defining how it would behave.
</li>
<li>Using spreadsheets was a good alternative for doing that. In the spreadsheet, it was possible to define the user
  stories - which actions the user would perform on the website - and the routes and resources that the application
  might need.
</li>
<li>It was also essential to work on the database design. For that, it was necessary to create a database schema with
  the probable tables and their attributes and think about the connections between them.
</li>
<li>Additionally, to keep track of changes in the code, it was necessary to create a Git repository and push the code up
  to GitHub. That was a way to guarantee that different versions of the code existed and could be used if anything went
  wrong.
</li>
<li>
  Moreover, Trello was used as a project dashboard to keep track of what needed to be done (had already been done and
  needed to be reviewed ).
</li>
<li>In order to design how the application would look, it was necessary to use Figma.</li>
<li>Figma was used to create the different screens of the website and the user flow - how the user would interact with
  the application and where each screen would take them. The colors, logo arrangement, and fonts were also chosen on
  Figma.</li>
<li>Another critical aspect of PerfectPresent was using an external API to display gifts that could be purchased in an
  online store. Mercado Livre's e-commerce API was used to solve this challenge. Its extensive array of existing
  products and categories helped show carefully selected gifts based on the questions answered by the user.</li>
<li>
  Finally, it was necessary to select a hosting platform for deployment to see the web application on the web. Heroku
  was used for deploying the application, and it also generated a web address that could be shared with other people so
  they could start using PerfectPresent.
