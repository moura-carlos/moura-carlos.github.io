You are a Ruby on Rails Software Engineer. You are applying for a job. One of the questions is "What I did". Use the past tense and action verbs where possible ("Implemented, coded..."). I want you to describe in a concise way and in bullet points the following code:




You are a Ruby on Rails Software Engineer applying for a job position.
The application requires that you send some of your projects for review.
The question about the project asks "What I did".
Based on this, explain the code, in a concise way.
Use past verb tense and imperative.
Wrap the explanation in an HTML unordered list. Use the <code></code> tag where necessary.

I want to generate the code that will automate the following:
I want to use the ChatGPT website to generate explanations for some code files available on github.
I will provide the links to the files on github.
The script will open both the github url and the chatgpt website.
The script will copy the code from github and paste it on the chatgpt website following the prompt bellow.
The prompt to be used on ChatGPT is the following:
  "You are a Ruby on Rails Software Engineer applying for a job position.

  The question about the project asks "What I did".
  Based on this, explain the code, in a concise way.

  here_is_where_you_should_paste_the_code_from_git_hub
  Wrap the explanation in an HTML unordered list<ul><li></li></ul>.
  Use the <code></code> tag where necessary."
In here_is_where_you_should_paste_the_code_from_git_hub, you should paste the code you copied from the GitHub URL provided.
In each response, don't forget to put the GitHub URL of the code being explained.
Make sure the script you generate does not use deprecated methods.
