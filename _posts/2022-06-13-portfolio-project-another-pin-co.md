<h4 id="goal">Project Goal</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The project aimed at creating an online store for selling clothing pins.
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the tasks to accomplish this goal were developing the website to display the products, creating the admin dashboard, adding a form where the user could enter their payment information as well as delivery address, making sure customers receive an e-mail with a thank you message and order details when successfully completing a purchase, and then deploying it to a server so that other people could access it using a URL.</li>
  <li>The abovementioned tasks had to be broken down into actionable steps.</li>
  <li>First, it was necessary to create an initial draft of the application by defining how it would behave.</li>
  <li>Using spreadsheets was a good alternative for doing that. In the spreadsheet, it was possible to define the user stories - which actions the customer would perform on the website - and the routes and resources that the application might need.</li>
  <li>It was also essential to work on the database design. For that, it was necessary to create a database schema with the probable tables and their attributes and think about the connections between them.</li>
  <li>Additionally, to keep track of changes in the code, it was necessary to create a Git repository and push the code up to GitHub. That was a way to guarantee that different versions of the code existed and could be used if anything went wrong.</li>
  <li>Moreover, Trello was used as a project dashboard to keep track of what needed to be done (had already been done and needed to be reviewed ).</li>
  <li>Another critical aspect of AnotherPin Co. was using an external API to process the user payment and another one for sending an e-mail with the order details as soon as the user successfully completed their purchase. For payment processing, it was convenient and reliable to use Stripe's payment API as it provides a safe way to handle credit card information. When it comes to sending e-mails, it was necessary to use Sendinblue transactional emails' API. It allowed the application to send an e-mail to the customer with the details of their order as soon as the purchase was successfully completed.</li>
  <li>Finally, it was necessary to select a hosting platform for deployment to see the web application on the web. Scalingo was used for deploying the application, and it also generated a web address that could be shared with other people so they could start purchasing on AnotherPin Co.</li>
