<h4 id="role">Role</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I was a Full-Stack Software Engineer for this project.
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goal">Project Goal</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The objective was to create a website where people could register for available events, check who was registered, and like the events if they so wanted.
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the tasks to accomplish this goal were developing the website to display the events, implementing an admin user role, making sure the admins could upload an image that represented an event so that the users could see it, and then deploying the project to a server so that other people could access it using a URL.</li>
  <li>The abovementioned tasks had to be broken down into actionable steps.</li>
  <li>First, it was necessary to create an initial draft of the application by defining how it would behave.</li>
  <li>Using spreadsheets was a good alternative for doing that.</li>
  <li>In the spreadsheet, it was possible to define the user stories - which actions the customer would perform on the website - and the routes and resources that the application might need.</li>
  <li>It was also essential to work on the database design.</li>
  <li>For that, it was necessary to create a database schema with the probable tables and their attributes and think about the connections between them.</li>
  <li>Additionally, to keep track of changes in the code, it was necessary to create a Git repository and push the code up to GitHub.</li>
  <li>That was a way to guarantee that different versions of the code existed and could be used if anything went wrong.</li>
  <li>Moreover, Trello was used as a project dashboard to keep track of what needed to be done (had already been done and needed to be reviewed ).</li>
  <li>Additionally, instead of just showing all the events to the user at once, it was necessary to give the users the option to narrow down the movies displayed by implementing some filters. These filters allowed the users, for example, to display the events based on whether they had already passed and on their price - whether they were free or not.</li>
  <li>Moreover, it was critical to consider how the image upload storage would be handled.</li>
  <li>For this, it was convenient, reliable, and flexible to use Amazon AWS cloud services, more specifically using an S3 bucket for storing the images and then making use of them to display on the website.</li>
  <li>Finally, it was necessary to select a hosting platform for deployment to see the web application on the web. Heroku was used for deploying the application, and it also generated a web address that could be shared with other people so they could start registering for the events available on Eventz.</li>
</ul>
