  <li>I worked as a Full-Stack Software Engineer in this project</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goal">Project Goal</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A Reddit clone website had to be created.</li>
  <li>To do so, it was necessary to grasp the major features of Reddit in order to incorporate them on the clone website.</li>
  <li>Furthermore, it was critical to consider four other aspects of the application: hosting, sending emails to users whenever someone commented on their submissions, having an admin user to act as a moderator on the platform, and having a premium membership so that a user with a paid membership does not see ads when logged in to the application.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Some of the tasks to accomplish this goal were developing the website,
  connecting it to a payment API so that users could get a paid membership,
  and then deploying it to a server so that other people could access it using a
  URL.</li>
  <li> The abovementioned tasks had to be broken down into actionable steps.</li>
  <li> First, it was necessary to create an initial draft of the application by defining
  how it would behave.</li>
  <li> Using spreadsheets was a good alternative for doing that. In the spreadsheet,
  it was possible to define the user stories - which actions the user would
  perform on the website - and the routes and resources that the application
  might need.</li>
  <li> It was also essential to work on the database design.</li>
  <li> For that, it was necessary to create a database schema with the probable
  tables and their attributes and think about the connections between them.</li>
  <li> Additionally, to keep track of changes in the code, it was necessary to create
  a Git repository and push the code up to GitHub. That was a way to
  guarantee that different versions of the code existed and could be used if
  anything went wrong.</li>
  <li> Moreover, Trello was used as a project dashboard to keep track of what
  needed to be done (had already been done and needed to be reviewed ).</li>
  <li> By looking at the original Reddit website it was possible to get a sense of how
  the user would behave on the application and which screens would lead to
  different places on the webpage.</li>
  <li> Another essential component of Webbit was the usage of an external API to
  handle payments in order for users to obtain a premium membership. Users
  who have a premium membership would no longer see advertisements on the
  website. Stripe's API was used to solve this problem. Its API allowed for the
  creation of a membership product as well as cancellation when a user no
  longer desired the subscription.</li>
  <li> Finally, it was necessary to select a hosting platform for deployment to see
  the web application on the web. Heroku was used for deploying the
  application, and it also generated a web address that could be shared with
  other people so they could start using Webbit.</li>
</ul>
